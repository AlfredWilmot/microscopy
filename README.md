# microscopy
A collection of code and images relevant to my exploration into microscopy.

[This collection of notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17NxTzuQR3ikOsvMRDz47dBdFxsa6I9eFPR8ApNF9aJs/edit?usp=sharing) covers how the Stemi 508 config file is generated for zen blue, and how to perform a particle analysis using ImageJ to generate a csv for final characterization/processing using python.
